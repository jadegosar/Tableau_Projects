## NBA.twbx
This file contains two dashboards, the first of which shows a NBA player's shooting efficiency based on location on the floor and the second which provides a look at shooting efficiency across the season. 

**Data Description and Cleaning**
The dataset used for this project was from the 2016-17 NBA season that includes shooting information for players such as where the shot was taken from on the court, shot zone, shot distance, and whether it was made or not. In addition to these metrics, the dataset included game information such as the date of the game and where the game was being played that was used to create a calculated field that determined whether the team was playing at home or away. Another feature that was engineered from the available data was total time remaining in the period to allow for users to filter the shot chart to a specific time frame within each period and provide more context on what type of shots the team or individual player are taking in that time interval.
